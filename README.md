# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis was to provide the stock performance for the 12 stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 for Steve to show his parents which ones would be best for them to invest with.

## Results:
As shown in the data, most of the stocks that were returned in the positive (green) in 2017, unfortunately returned in the negative (red) in 2018. With the exception of two: ENPH and RUN.
Our previous run time for both years were ~0.4 seconds. Now if you reference the images bellow, you will see that it went down to 0.1328125 seconds for 2017 and 0.1367188 seconds for 2018.

## Summary:
The advantages of running a refactor code is that with a click of a button you are able to get a summary of the information you were looking for. As opposed to searching for each stock information individually and then adding it to the new worksheet.
The disadvantage of running a refactor code is that if your macro does not work 100% correctly, either you will end up providing the wrong information, or no information depending how many errors your macro has.
Refactoring the original VBA helps because instead of looking for the information of one stock now we are looking for the information of all 12. Setting up the refactor helps us get all 12 stocks just as quickly as getting it for one. But again, if the macro does not run properly it may provide the incorrect information, and due to that Steve's parents might invest in the wrong stock.
